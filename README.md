# Phys155Project
Mentoring project folder for understanding phase transitions

## Goal of the project
- Main goal is to get a feel for what phase transitions are and why they are so generally applicable. Hopefully you'll get a taste of physics, particular statistical mechanics, and get interested in research.
- Two problems. The first is about percolation, which will be more of a warm up exercise. The second is about the Ising model, which become more and more open ended at the end.   
- For the presentation, just demonstrate what you've learnt in simple words to your peers.

## Expectations and Guidelines
- Be kind, work collaborativelyi please. There is no competition, just learn what you can.
- Minimal use of AI, limited to conceptual questions please.
- I will do my best to be adaptable to your backgrounds and expectations for the project.
- 5 hours of work per week
- Please please comment your code with your thoughts

## Reading
1. Motivation. Section 1.1 of David Tong's [Statistical Physics lecture notes](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/statphys/statphys.pdf)
2. [Introduction to the Ising Model by Barry Cirpa](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/isingIntro.pdf) until the start of section 2.
