# Phys155Project
Mentoring project folder for understanding phase transitions

## Goal of the project
- Main goal is to get a feel for what phase transitions are and why they are so generally applicable. Hopefully you'll get a taste of physics, particular statistical mechanics, and get interested in research.
- Two problems. The first is about percolation, which will be more of a warm up exercise. The second is about the Ising model, which become more and more open ended at the end.   
- For the presentation, just demonstrate what you've learnt in simple words to your peers.

## Expectations and Guidelines
- Be kind, work collaborativelyi please. There is no competition, just learn what you can.
- Minimal use of AI, limited to conceptual questions please.
- I will do my best to be adaptable to your backgrounds and expectations for the project.
- 5 hours of work per week
- Please please comment your code with your thoughts

## Reading
1. Motivation. Section 1.1 of David Tong's [Statistical Physics lecture notes](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/statphys/statphys.pdf)
2. [Introduction to the Ising Model by Barry Cirpa](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~scs/Courses/Stat376/Papers/isingIntro.pdf) until the start of section 2.

## Project Checklist
### Week of Monday 3rd November
- [x] Pseudo code for percolation
- [x] Reading 1 and 2
- [x] Send Liam questions about 1 and 2
- [x] Fill in code and produce successful throughput probability vs metallic probability
### Week of Monday 10th November
- [x] Discussion on the week of November 10th about reading 1 and 2.
- [] 1D Ising problem analytic calculation and exploring properties

From what we discussed, the 1D Ising model is:
```math
H = - J \sum_i^{N-1} \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1},
```

where we call $J$ the coupling constant, and we will care about $J > 0$ (Ferromagnetic), $i$ means sites, and the spin $\sigma_i$ can be $\uparrow$ (taking the value $+1$), or $\downarrow$ (taking the value $-1$).

Some questions for the 1D Ising problem:

1. Just to recap what we've discussed. Could you describe t
2. 
3.


### Week of Monday 17th November
