    "- I'll set up this Jupyter-Notebook to walk you through, fill in the blanks with prompting questions.\n",
    "- As discussed on our first meeting, we want to model percolation as a graph or a connected square grid.\n",
    "- At the end, I'll include some open ended questions and you can try implementing them yourself based on the code that I provide and you have filled in."
